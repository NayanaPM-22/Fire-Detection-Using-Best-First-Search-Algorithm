# 🔥 Fire Detection Using Best First Search Algorithm

This project implements a **lightweight, vision-based fire detection system** using the **Best First Search (BFS) algorithm** guided by pixel brightness heuristics.  
It is designed for **real-time detection** on **low-resource and edge devices**, avoiding heavy deep learning models while maintaining high sensitivity to fire regions.

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional fire detection systems rely on sensors such as smoke or heat detectors, which may suffer from limited coverage and false alarms.  
This project uses **image processing and heuristic search** to detect fire regions directly from images and GIFs.

The algorithm starts from the **brightest pixel** in an image and expands to neighboring pixels using **Best First Search**, grouping high-intensity regions that are likely to represent fire.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. **Input Module** – Loads images or GIFs  
2. **Preprocessing** – Grayscale conversion and Gaussian blur  
3. **Detection Engine** – BFS-based fire region detection  
4. **Validation** – Filters small or sparse bright regions  
5. **Alert System** – Triggers audio alarm  
6. **GUI Interface** – Displays original and processed images

## 🔬 Algorithm Used

### Best First Search (BFS)

- Each pixel is treated as a node
- Search starts from the brightest pixel
- Neighboring pixels are expanded based on intensity
- A priority queue ensures high-intensity pixels are explored first

This approach focuses computation only on **fire-like regions**, improving efficiency.
